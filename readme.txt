Data on prescription drug spending was obtained from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Spending numbers were available for Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B and Medicaid, for years 2012-2016.

The original data for all three programs can be viewed on CMS.gov's online dashboard, or downloaded from there as an Excel file. The original, unmodified files are also in the data/raw-files directory of this repo.

For each program, the annual spending on individual MS drugs was compared against total spending program wide. For Medicare Part D and Medicaid, the average year-over-year spending growth for each drug (and the aggregate for all drugs) was calculated, and the annual spending, per patient, of each MS drug was visualized.
